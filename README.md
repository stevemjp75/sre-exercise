# Site Reliability Engineer Exercise

## Objective

Develop a networked service that allows users to upload a file via a browser and receive the MD5 hash of its contents in response.

## Specification

- You must write a server program in a programming/scripting language of your choice.
- You must not use any cloud services e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP.
- The server program must run in Docker on an in-support Linux or Windows operating system.
- You may use any freely available open-source libraries that you feel are appropriate.
- Deployment and maintenance should be as easy as possible.
- The technology choices must be easy and free to procure.

You must provide one or more text files containing brief but clear instructions describing:
1. How to deploy and maintain your service.
2. How a user is expected to interact with your service.
3. Any additional information you feel is required for your service.

## Allowances

- Files uploaded by users do not need to be saved on the server for later retrieval.
- The load on the service is expected to be very light.
- There is no need to secure communication between the browser and server in any way.

## Assessment

We are looking for evidence of the following:
- You have programming experience.
- You have knowledge and experience relating to the deployment and maintenance of networked services.
- You can effectively document a technical solution.
- You can effectively communicate with a technical audience.

It is anticipated that this exercise should take approximately 120 minutes. You may take longer, but perfection is not expected. If you feel the need to do so, you may include notes on what you would do if more time were available. When returning your solution, please confirm the length of time taken to complete.

Once you have submitted your solution, we will review it. 

If you are subsequently invited to a final stage face-to-face interview, you will be asked to complete a 5-to-10-minute presentation on your solution. After the presentation, the interview panel will ask follow-up questions.

This presentation should include:
- The rationale for your technology choices.
- Detail the issues you had creating the solution and how you resolved them.
- What you would do if more time were available.
- How you would deploy this in a production environment where high availability and high load are a factor.

Please return this exercise directly to us, and do not pass this exercise on to anyone else.

Good luck!
